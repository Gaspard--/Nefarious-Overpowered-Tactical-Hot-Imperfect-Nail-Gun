You're introduced in the enemy base to test your new weapon : NOTHING. Mmmm ... I mean, your Nefarious Overpowered Tactical Hot Imperfect Nail Gun.

## Gameplay

* Move with **[QZD]**/**[AWD]**/**[Left-Up-Right]**
* Shoot and control your N.O.T.H.I.N.G with the **mouse** and the **left click**.
* Eat enemies with the **right click** or the **space bar** to become bigger and stronger, but don't let enemies eat you !
* The N.O.T.H.I.N.G is an overpowered tactical nail gun:
  * Shoot too much an it will overheat, and you will drop it!
    * You can fly much better when your gun is dropped
    * Enemies can steal and give you hell, be careful!
  * The higher the heat, the faster you shoot
  * You can nail enemies to walls and platforms, this makes them harmless
  * You can nail enemies to enemies (rarer)
* You shrink over time, feed yourself to stay alive

There are a few bugs linked to terrain generation. If you start in a small room, restart pls :P
* Enjoy our game :)
